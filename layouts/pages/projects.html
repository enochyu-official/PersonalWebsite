        While exploring concepts further in mathematics, I was able to acquire
        countless assistance from public documents. Therefore, to reciprocate
        the blessings received, I enjoy typing numerous topics taught in Olympiad
        and competition mathematics to share the documents publicly. Contributing
        through sharing the documents provides joy through the sensation that I
        have ceased to be only a consumer, but became both producer and consumer
        of math.

        Competitive programming provides a distinct joy from contemplating
        on a mathematical problem. Investigating the interconnected nature
        of competitive programming and ideas from Olympiad mathematics is
        one of the most prominent reasons for enjoying to program.
        Through pursuing distinct challenge, I was able to acquire limited,
        but potent knowledge in programming. The project below includes my
        journey in C++ and basic concepts from competitive programming.
