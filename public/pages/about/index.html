    <h2 id="who-am-i">Who Am I?</h2>
    <p>
    Hi!! My name is Enoch Yu, a high school sophomore in South
    Korea. I am captivated by numerous fields, primarily
    mathematics, programming, and music. The beauty of logic
    behind symbols and codes in mathematics and programming
    stimulated to hope to further study both pure mathematics
    and computer science in university.
    <br><br>
    If one word can describe myself, it is the word perseverance.
    I believe that the ability to not surrender to a problem due
    to difficulty is one of the most beautiful qualities of a human
    being. Consequently, one strength that I am proud of is the
    ability to persist. For instance, despite numerous failures
    in mathematics such as not being qualified to represent Korea
    for the International Mathematical Olympiad, I continue to
    assiduously pursue mathematics. Considering failures as another
    challenge and chance to continue the pursuit allowed me to
    persevere under difficult circumstances.
    <br><br>
    Similarly, obtaining an optimistic mindset on oneself is
    another strength that I am proud of. Under strenuous
    circumstances, I believe that I am an entity that possesses
    silent radiance. In parallel to the fact that an enormous fire
    is initiated with a mere scintilla, I believe that every
    individual possesses silent radiance that is on the verge of
    becoming effulgent. For example, one of the primary stimuli for
    assiduously studying is to not dissipate the scintilla that is
    anticipating to burst brilliant light. Through a positive
    perspective of life, I believe I am able to value my learning
    experience.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ultimate-goal">Ultimate Goal</h2>
    <p>
    I have two primary goals in my life. The ultimate goal is
    establishing a Christian university in North Korea. The second
    primary goal is founding a hedge fund on Wall Street, which
    behaves as the cornerstone for the first goal.
    <br><br>
    First, to achieve both visions, I wish to gain further insight
    on the global economy by advancing as a quantitative researcher.
    Despite being a highly selective career, I believe learning as a
    quantitative researcher, while pursuing academic journey for Ph.D
    in a field in pure mathematics, will accelerate my journey as it
    aligns with my interest in mathematics and computer science.
    <br><br>
    After gaining insights on global economy and social experience as
    a quantitative researcher and credibility by pursuing Ph.D in a
    field in pure mathematics, I sincerely wish to found a hedge fund
    is Wall Street and Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) to secure
    capital and aspiring people for constructing a Christian university
    in North Korea, immediately following the reunification anticipated
    future.
    <br><br>
    One may ask, "Why a university in North Korea?" The primary
    motivation is to reciprocate the blessings received from countless
    American missionaries and people from diverse nations. Just as the
    commitments from countless people initiated the changes for South
    Korea from the late 19th century, I wish to contribute to the unified
    nation by ameliorate education in North side of Korea. Moreover,
    I was not able to think of a better way to thank God for the blessings
    that He gave to me and South Korea then working for His people and
    nation!!
